# Panqueque: A simple simulator of a Canonical Stack Machine

This is an adaptation of the Canonical Stack Machine presented by Koopman 
(1989, chapter 3), and the Forth programming language by Moore (1974).

Heavily inspired by the work of Nakano et al. (2008), the PL0 Machine by
and the S-machine, an adaptation of the PL0 Machine (Wirth, 1976) by Anthony 
Aaby (1995).

If you want to implement a real hardware Stack Machine I suggest you to check
the FPGA design by Nanako et al. (2008).

**Author**: Diego Caro

**Notes**: This is a work-in-progress work, and still need a return 
       stack plus operations to be a fully Turing Complete
       machine. Hopefully it will be ready during 2021.
